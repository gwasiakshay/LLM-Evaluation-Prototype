# Day 1 Notes â€“ Environment Setup & ROUGE Evaluation

## âœ… Completed Setup
- Installed Python and added it to PATH
- Installed VS Code with Python + Jupyter extensions
- Installed essential Python libraries:
  - `evaluate`, `rouge_score`, `nltk`, `absl-py`
  - `transformers`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `openai`, `streamlit`
- Installed Git + GitHub Desktop and signed in
- Added Streamlit and other CLI tools to system PATH
- Installed PyTorch (CPU version) for model loading
- Verified setup by running a ROUGE evaluation script

## ðŸ§ª Key Learnings
- ROUGE is a metric for comparing generated summaries to reference texts
- `evaluate` library loads metrics like ROUGE and computes scores
- Missing dependencies (like `rouge_score`, `nltk`) must be manually installed
- PATH issues can block CLI tools like `streamlit` â€” fixed via Environment Variables

## ðŸ’¡ Reflections
- First hands-on experience with Python scripting and terminal workflows
- Learned how to troubleshoot installation issues and PATH errors
- Setup now ready for GenAI evaluation pipelines and dashboarding

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Load a financial summary or PDF
- Generate output using a GenAI model
- Evaluate using ROUGE and visualize results in Streamlit
